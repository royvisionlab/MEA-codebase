# MEA: Analysis tools for data collected on UC Santa Cruz multi-electrode arrays.

I highly recommend using conda environments for setting up these analysis tools. This makes it possible to delete/upgrade/reinstall environments if needed. Conda can be installed on your computer using the following links: [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/mac-os/) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html), which is a lightweight version of Anaconda.
