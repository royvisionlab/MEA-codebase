The STA File format
======================

Field format: the letter "i" (signed integer) or "f" (floating point) followed by the number 
of bytes. The encoding is Big Endian.

======================

1) THE HEADER (164 bytes long) 

i4: version - curently 32
i4: number of entries in the seek table (the max. number of STA that can be stored)
i4: STA width (in stixels)
i4: STA height (in stixels)
i4: STA depth (in frames)
f8: stixel size (in pixels, calculated as 640/width)
f8: refresh time (in milliseconds)
128 bytes - reserved for future additions (zeroed)


2) THE SEEK TABLE

i4: neuron ID (from neurons file)
i8: seek location (from beginning of file)
---- repeated "number of entries in the seek table" times

A "neuron ID" value of "-2147483648" means the slot is empty (unused). 


3) THE DATA AREA

for each stores STA:
  f8: refresh time (in milliseconds)
  i4: STA depth (in frames)
 
  for each frame in the STA, STA depth of them
    i4: STA width (in stixels)
    i4: STA height (in stixels)
    f8: stixel size (in pixels, calculated as 640/width)
    
    for every stixel in the frame - repeated "nPixels = width * height" times. 
    Pixels order is row-major, that is left to right and top to botton.
      f4: red value
      f4: red error
      f4: green value
      f4: green error
      f4: blue value
      f4: blue error


----------------------------------------
Reading the File:
1) read the header for general info
2) load ant store in memory the whole seek table
3) to read an STA by ID:
   a) find the entry in the seek table with the needed ID
   b) seek to the corresponding location in the file (from beginning)
   c) read the STA frame by frame and pixel by pixel

the STA size in bytes is:
 8 + 4 + staDepth * (4 + 4 + 8 + width * height * 3 * 2 * 4)
