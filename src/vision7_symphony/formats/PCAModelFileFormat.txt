The PCA Clustering Model File format
======================
Stores all the information about the gauusians used to fit (EM) the PCA generated 
multi-dimensional scatter plots.

Field format: the letter "s" (signed), "u" (unsigned) or f (floating point) followed 
by the number of bytes.
The encoding is Big Endian.



The first structure in the file is the VisionHeader.

{ The list of EM results, each slot describes an electrode
  s4: The electrode index
  s4: nGaussians - The number of gaussians that form the mixture model
  { The list of gaussian parameters and the neuron ID to which they correspond
    s4: the neuron ID
    f8: p(j) - the probability of the mixture component
    f8[nDimensions]: the mean of the gaussian
    f8[nDimensions]: the diagonal ellements of the covariance matrix of the gaussian
  } repeats "nGaussians" times
} repeats up to "nElectrodes" times 

(some electrodes may not have a record because of insufficient number of spikes)
